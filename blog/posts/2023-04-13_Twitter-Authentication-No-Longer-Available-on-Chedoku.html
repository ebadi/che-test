	  <div class="column col-xs-1"><p>We integrated Twitter login authentication into our Chedoku web application since Dec 6, 2022. However, today we have received a notice that our application has been suspended for no reason. We have opened a ticket to address this issue, but unfortunately, we don't have much hope that their decision will be reversed. Therefore, we have decided to discontinue the use of Twitter login authentication. If you have been affected by this change, please contact us via email. We will copy your profile information to your new account to ensure a seamless transition.</p>
