<h2><a href="https://goofy-fermat-5b2dec.netlify.app">Knight's tour</a></h2>
<p>A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once. If the knight ends on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square (so that it could tour the board again immediately, following the same path), the tour is closed (or re-entrant); otherwise, it is open.</p>
